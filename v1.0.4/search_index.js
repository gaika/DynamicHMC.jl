    "text": "This package implements a variant of the “No-U-Turn Sampler” of Hoffmann and Gelman (2014), as described in Betancourt (2017). In order to make the best use of this package, you should read at least the latter paper thoroughly.This package is mainly useful for Bayesian inference. In order to use it, you need to be familiar with the conceptual building blocks of Bayesian inference, most importantly, you should be able to code a (log) posterior as a function in Julia. For various techniques and a discussion of MCMC methods (eg domain transformations, or integrating out discrete parameters), you may find the Stan Modeling Language manual helpful. If you are unfamiliar with Bayesian methods, Bayesian Data Analysis is a good introduction, among other great books.The package aims to “do one thing and do it well”: given a log density functionell mathbbR^k to mathbbRfor which you have values ell(x) and the gradient nabla ell(x), it samples values from a densityp(x) propto exp(ell(x))using the algorithm above.The package provides a framework to tune the algorithm to find near-optimal parameters for sampling, and also diagnostics that are specific to the algorithm.However, following a modular approach, it does not provideDomain transformations from subsets of mathbbR^k. For that, see TransformVariables.jl.\nAutomatic differentiation. Julia has a thriving AD ecosystem which should allow you to implement this. This package uses LogDensityProblems.jl for defining (log) density functions, which already has some one-liner solutions for AD, and is easily extensible for other methods.\nGeneric MCMC diagnostics not specific to NUTS. See MCMCDiagnostics.jl for an implementation of hatR and effective sample size calculations."
